Latent Variable Problem
==========================================

In a Bayesian *latent variable* problem, the model includes a set of unobserved variables, in addition to the variables parameterizing the distribution that we want to estimate.

That is, we have a probability distribution of the following form:    
 :math:`p( d, z  | \psi )`

Here, d are observed data points, z the latent variables, and :math:`\psi` the distribution parameters (aka hyperparameters).

Do not use this class directly, but instead one of the subclasses `Exponential Latent`
and `Hierarchical Latent`. An `Exponential Latent`
problem makes less assumptions on the distribution - it assumes that it belongs to the
exponential family. An `Hierarchical Latent` problem instead assumes a hierarchical
probability structure. Please refer to their respective documentation.


Configuration
-------------


Variable-Specific Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each variable you define, please set

.. code-block:: python

    e["Variable"][your_index][ "Bayesian Type" ] = "Latent"
    # or:
    e["Variable"][your_index][ "Bayesian Type" ] = "Hyperparameter"

to select what role this variable takes in the problem. Note that for `Hierarchical Latent`
problems, you can only declare latent variables and select their distribution; hyperparameters
will be inferred.
